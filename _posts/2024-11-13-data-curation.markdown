description: Exploring what makes winners winners in college basketball, and why they stay that way.

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ollege Basketball is one of the most thrilling sports to watch. Every school has a rabid student section who pack their arena night in and night out to make as much noise as possible. It seems like on any given night, upsets are bound to happen with teams you've never even heard of taking down perennial powerhouses. But that begs the question: What makes these teams perennial powerhouses? Why is there this supposed upper echelon of teams each year that seems like it rarely changes? As an avid college basketball fan myself, I wanted to explore two specific questions. What are the key components of being a winning team in college basketball, and is there really an upper tier of teams that never really changes? This intro to exploratory data analysis will help answer those questions.</p>

### Ethical Scraping Practices

Data is necessary for everyone from players to general managers if they want to draw conclusions about how to win. While available almost everywhere, you have to be careful and mindful about how you go about collecting data. When scraping data or using APIs, it is important to understand the rules and regulations in place from where you are scraping or pulling data. Pay close attention to the terms of whatever site you are using to collect your data.

In this case, the data and statistics were scraped from [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/#all_NCAAM_schools), an online repository for sports statistics. It is free to scrape and available to the public, with the only caveat being a citation necessary. You can find that citation at the bottom of the page. Ultimately, the most important idea to keep in mind is be familiar with the guidelines your specific website is requesting.
